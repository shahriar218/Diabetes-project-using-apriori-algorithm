# Diabetes_Apriori_ML
This machine learning project informs us of the diseases that a diabetic patient actually has in common throughout all disease sets of diabetes patients.
Patients with diabetes contributed to the dataset.
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze data and identify patterns that can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. This ML project uses the Apriori algorithm to identify the diseases that are most commonly associated with diabetes. The dataset used for this project consists of patient records of individuals with diabetes, and the algorithm is used to identify patterns in the co-occurrence of different diseases among these patients. The results show that certain diseases are more commonly associated with diabetes than others, providing valuable insights for medical professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms, specifically the Apriori algorithm, in identifying patterns in large datasets and providing useful information for medical professionals.
